# CMVP Capstone — Greenfield Municipal Center

Interactive M&V workbench and paper packet for the 3-day CMVP certification training course.

**Live site:** [cmvp-capstone.vercel.app](https://cmvp-capstone.vercel.app/)

## What It Is

Students build a complete M&V plan for a realistic 62,000 sq ft government facility with 4 ECMs under an ESPC contract. The capstone combines a printed paper packet (PDF workbook) with an interactive web app covering all 9 CMVP exam domains.

## The Scenario

**Greenfield Municipal Center** — mid-Atlantic climate (Zone 4A), 4 wings, 4 ECMs:

| ECM | Description | Approach |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| ECM-1 | LED lighting + controls (Wings A & B) | Retrofit isolation / key parameter measurement |
| ECM-2 | Chiller/DX replacement | Student decides |
| ECM-3 | Roof insulation (R-15 → R-30) | Whole facility / inverse model |
| ECM-4 | VFDs on AHU supply fans | Retrofit isolation / continuous performance verification |

All energy data generated from calibrated EnergyPlus simulation with intentional teaching moments built in.

## Web App (7 Tabs)

| Tab | What Students Do |
|-----|-----------------|
| **Overview** | Explore building, wings, ECMs, and annual energy summary |
| **Scatter Plots** | Identify 5P electric and 3P gas patterns in baseline data |
| **Model Fitting** | Fit change-point models, validate against ASHRAE G14, examine residuals |
| **Lighting Stipulation** | Calculate ECM-1 savings from 740-fixture inventory |
| **VFD Analysis** | Compare pre/post fan performance across 3 AHUs |
| **Time Series** | Discover the NRA event by comparing baseline model to reporting data |
| **Savings Calculator** | Compute monthly savings, apply NRA adjustment, value in $ and CO₂ |

## Paper Packet (14 pages)

Generated by `scripts/build_packet.py`. Includes building elevation, floor plan, single-line diagram, and 11 worksheets across 3 phases.
