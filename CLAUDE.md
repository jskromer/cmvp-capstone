## 1. Building Description

**Greenfield Municipal Center** — a 62,000 sq ft (5,760 m²) mixed-use government facility in the mid-Atlantic region. Original construction ~1995, no prior major retrofits. Two stories, long axis E-W.

### Wing Layout

| Wing | Use | Area (sq ft) | Floors | Ceiling Height |
|------|-----|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Wing A | Office (open-plan + perimeter private) | 35,000 | 2 | 9 ft |
| Wing B | Public library & community meeting rooms | 15,000 | 2 | 12 ft (reading), 9 ft (meeting) |
| Wing C | Data center / IT operations | 2,000 | 1 | 9 ft (raised floor) |
| Common | Lobby, corridors, mechanical rooms | 10,000 | 2 | Variable |
| **Total** | | **62,000** | | |

### Envelope (Pre-Retrofit Baseline)

| Component | Construction | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Exterior walls | Steel stud, R-11 batt, brick veneer | U-0.09 Btu/hr·ft²·°F |
| Roof | Built-up roof | R-15 assembly |
| Windows | Double-pane clear, aluminum frame | U-0.55, SHGC 0.60 |
| Window-to-wall ratio | ~25% | |
| Infiltration | ~0.5 ACH (simplified) | |

## 2. HVAC Systems

### Heating — Critical Design Decision

The building uses a **split heating strategy** that creates the required 5-parameter change-point behavior on the electric side:

| Zone | Heating System | Fuel | Why |
|------|---------------|------|-----|
| Wing A (Office) | Gas furnace in AHU-1 | Natural gas | Preserves gas vs. OAT change-point |
| Wing B (Library) | Electric heat pump / electric coil in AHU-2 | Electricity | Creates electric heating leg in 5P model |
| Wing C (Data Center) | None (constant cooling) | — | Always cooling |
| Common Areas | Gas furnace in AHU-3 | Natural gas | Preserves gas vs. OAT change-point |

This split is architecturally realistic — many 1990s government buildings had packaged heat pumps on smaller wings with gas boilers on the main building, especially with phased construction.

### Air Handling Units — Baseline (Constant Volume)

| Unit | Serves | CFM | Fan HP | Fan ΔP | Heating | Cooling |
|------|--------|-----|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| AHU-1 | Wing A (35,000 ft²) | 15,000 | 15 | 750 Pa | Gas furnace | DX cooling |
| AHU-2 | Wing B (15,000 ft²) | 8,000 | 10 | 750 Pa | Electric coil / heat pump | DX cooling |
| AHU-3 | Common (10,000 ft²) | 5,000 | 5 | 750 Pa | Gas furnace | DX cooling |
| CRAC-1 | Wing C (2,000 ft²) | — | — | — | None | 5-ton DX, 24/7 |

All AHUs operate **constant volume** in the baseline — continuous fan, cycling heating/cooling. This is the pre-VFD condition that ECM-4 addresses.

### Temperature Setpoints
- Heating: 70°F occupied / 60°F unoccupied
- Cooling: 74°F occupied / 85°F unoccupied
- Data center: 68°F year-round

## 4. The Retrofit Package (ESPC Contract)

### Four ECMs — Actual Simulation Results

| ECM | Description | Actual Annual Savings | % of Baseline | M&V Approach |
|-----|-------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------|
| ECM-1 | LED lighting + controls (Wings A & B only) | Part of combined 122,390 kWh | — | Retrofit isolation — stipulated |
| ECM-2 | Chiller/DX replacement (all units) | Part of combined 122,390 kWh | — | Whole facility or retrofit isolation |
| ECM-3 | Roof insulation upgrade (R-15 → R-30) | Part of combined 122,390 kWh | — | Whole facility |
| ECM-4 | VFDs on AHU supply fans (AHU-1, 2, 3) | Part of combined 122,390 kWh | — | Retrofit isolation — measured |
| **Combined** | **All ECMs** | **122,390 kWh (10.5%)** | **10.5%** | |

**Note:** Individual ECM savings are not separable from the whole-facility simulation — they interact. This is realistic and is itself a teaching point. The combined savings are what the whole-facility model detects. Attribution to individual ECMs requires engineering estimates or retrofit isolation.

### Post-Retrofit HVAC Changes

| Unit | Baseline | Post-Retrofit (ECM-2 + ECM-4) |
|------|----------|-------------------------------|
| AHU-1 fan | CV, 750 Pa | VFD, ~400 Pa effective (ECM-4) |
| AHU-2 fan | CV, 750 Pa | VFD, ~400 Pa effective (ECM-4) |
| AHU-3 fan | CV, 750 Pa | VFD, ~400 Pa effective (ECM-4) |
| Cooling coils | COP 3.5 baseline | COP 4.5 post-retrofit (ECM-2) |

### Post-Retrofit Lighting (ECM-1: Wings A & B Only)

| Zone | Baseline LPD | Post-Retrofit LPD | Controls Added |
|------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Wing A Offices | 1.3 W/ft² | 0.65 W/ft² | Occupancy + daylight dimming |
| Wing B Library | 1.4 W/ft² | 0.70 W/ft² | Daylight dimming |
| Wing B Meeting | 1.2 W/ft² | 0.60 W/ft² | Vacancy sensors |
| Wing C Data Center | 1.5 W/ft² | **No change** | — |
| Common Areas | 1.0 W/ft² | **No change** | — |

### Post-Retrofit Envelope (ECM-3)
- Roof insulation: R-15 → R-30 (added continuous rigid insulation)

## 6. Key Pedagogical Features in the Data

### 6.1 Five-Parameter Electric Change-Point (5P)

The baseline electric scatter shows:
- **Heating leg** (OAT < ~48°F): Electric consumption rises due to Wing B heat pump
- **Deadband** (~48-63°F): Relatively flat, ~89-93k kWh/month
- **Cooling leg** (OAT > ~63°F): Consumption rises from chiller load
- **Heating slope < cooling slope**: Correct physics (gas handles most heating; only Wing B is electric)
- **February anomaly**: 93k kWh at 34.9°F — lower than expected due to 28 days. Students must decide whether to normalize by days-in-month.

### 6.2 Three-Parameter Gas Change-Point (3P Heating-Only)

The baseline gas scatter shows:
- Clear heating slope from cold months down to ~230 therms/month baseload
- Baseload = domestic hot water (constant year-round)
- Change point at approximately 60-65°F

### 6.3 Interactive Effects — Gas Goes UP After Retrofit

The LED lighting retrofit (ECM-1) removes ~50% of lighting waste heat in Wings A & B. In winter, that waste heat was "free heating." The gas AHUs now work harder → **gas consumption increases by 358 therms/yr (+6.2%)** despite the roof insulation (ECM-3) partially offsetting this.

**Teaching moment:** Students expect every ECM to save energy. They must explain why gas increased and address this in their M&V plan — either expand the measurement boundary to capture both fuels, or document and quantify the interactive effect.

### 6.4 Seasonal Savings Variation

| Season | Savings % | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Winter (Jan-Feb, Dec) | ~7% | Lighting saves kWh, but heating penalty eats some back |
| Shoulder (Mar-Apr, Oct-Nov) | ~8-10% | Moderate savings from all ECMs |
| Summer (May-Sep) | ~12-15% | Lighting + chiller + fans all push same direction |

**Teaching moment:** The baseline and reporting scatter plots don't shift uniformly — the gap widens on the cooling (right) side. Students must explain this asymmetry.

### 6.5 Non-Routine Adjustment (NRA) — Data Center Expansion

- **Event:** Data center load increases from 25 → 35 W/ft² (50 kW → 70 kW) starting August (Month 8)
- **Impact:** +18,300-19,200 kWh/month for months 8-12 = +93,984 kWh total
- **Effect:** Months 8-12 show **apparent negative savings** — reporting period consumption exceeds baseline
- **Magnitude:** The NRA (+94k kWh) is almost as large as the true savings (122k kWh), making it impossible to ignore

**Teaching moment:** A naive year-over-year comparison shows only 2.4% savings. After NRA adjustment, true savings are 10.5%. Students must detect, quantify, and adjust.

### 6.6 Savings Detectability — Borderline Uncertainty

At 10.5% savings with monthly data (12 baseline points), the fractional savings uncertainty at 90% confidence will be borderline — likely 40-60% depending on model CV(RMSE). Students will discover in Day 3 that:
- The savings are *just barely* statistically significant
- This raises the question: is monthly whole-facility precise enough, or do they need more granular data?
- This is a real professional judgment call that maps to Domains 4, 5, and 8

## 7. ECM-1 Lighting Stipulation Data

For the retrofit isolation / stipulated savings exercise (Day 2):

### Wing A — Office Lighting Inventory

| Space Type | Qty | Baseline Fixture | Base W | Retrofit Fixture | Retro W | ΔW/fixture |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|--------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| Open office | 280 | 2×4 3-lamp T8 | 96 | 2×4 LED troffer | 40 | 56 |
| Private office | 60 | 2×4 2-lamp T8 | 64 | 2×4 LED troffer | 32 | 32 |
| Conference | 12 | 2×4 3-lamp T8 | 96 | 2×4 LED troffer | 40 | 56 |
| Break room | 8 | 2×4 2-lamp T8 | 64 | 2×4 LED troffer | 32 | 32 |
| Restroom | 20 | 1×4 2-lamp T8 | 64 | 1×4 LED strip | 25 | 39 |

### Wing B — Library Lighting Inventory

| Space Type | Qty | Baseline Fixture | Base W | Retrofit Fixture | Retro W | ΔW/fixture |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|--------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| Reading room | 80 | High-bay T8 (6-lamp) | 192 | LED high-bay | 90 | 102 |
| Stacks | 60 | 2×4 2-lamp T8 | 64 | 2×4 LED troffer | 28 | 36 |
| Meeting rooms | 24 | 2×4 3-lamp T8 | 96 | 2×4 LED troffer | 40 | 56 |
| Children's area | 16 | 2×4 3-lamp T8 | 96 | 2×4 LED troffer | 40 | 56 |

### Operating Hours for Stipulation

| Zone | Annual Hours | Basis |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Wing A Office | 3,120 hrs | M-F 7am-6pm, 52 weeks + 10% after-hours |
| Wing B Library | 3,900 hrs | Published library hours (M-Sat + Sun) |
| Wing B Meeting | 1,560 hrs | ~30 hrs/wk from booking system records |

### Stipulated Savings Calculation (for students to perform)

Students calculate: **Savings = Σ (ΔW × Qty × Annual Hours) / 1,000**

The result (~80,000-90,000 kWh) will **not match** the whole-facility simulation savings — because the stipulation doesn't account for interactive effects (reduced lighting heat → more heating, less cooling). This mismatch is the teaching point.

## 8. Utility Rate Structure

For savings valuation in Day 3:

### Electric Rate

|-----------|------|
| Energy charge | $0.085/kWh (flat) |
| Demand charge | $12.50/kW-month (15-min peak) |
| Customer charge | $125/month |
| Fuel adjustment | $0.015/kWh |

**Blended rate:** ~$0.100/kWh (energy + fuel adj)

### Emission Factors

| Fuel | Factor |
|------|--------|
| Electricity | 0.85 lbs CO₂/kWh (PJM grid average) |

### Quick Valuation (for students to verify)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Electric savings value (no NRA) | 122,390 kWh × $0.100 = ~$12,200/yr |
| Gas penalty | 358 therms × $1.17 = ~$420/yr |
| Net cost savings | ~$11,800/yr |
| CO₂ reduction (electric) | 122,390 × 0.85 / 2,205 = ~47 metric tons/yr |
| CO₂ increase (gas) | 358 × 11.7 / 2,205 = ~1.9 metric tons/yr |
| Net CO₂ reduction | ~45 metric tons/yr |

## 11. Notes for React Workbench Development

### What the workbench needs to do with this data:

1. **Load CSVs** from `public/data/` via fetch
2. **Scatter plot** baseline electric vs. OAT — students visually identify the 5P shape
3. **Model fitting** — let students select 2P, 3P, 4P, 5P models and see which fits best
4. **Validation stats** — R², CV(RMSE), NMBE, t-statistics against ASHRAE Guideline 14
5. **Savings calculation** — apply fitted baseline model to reporting period conditions
6. **NRA detection** — overlay reporting data and see the step change
7. **NRA adjustment** — students quantify and remove the NRA effect
8. **Gas analysis** — same workflow for gas (3P heating model)
9. **Uncertainty** — fractional savings uncertainty at 90% confidence

### What the workbench does NOT need to do:

- Run EnergyPlus (all simulation data is pre-generated)
- Individual ECM attribution (that's the stipulation exercise + engineering judgment)
- Hourly analysis (stretch goal — monthly is the core exercise)
