## 1. Building Description

**Greenfield Municipal Center** — a 62,000 sq ft (5,760 m²) mixed-use government facility in the mid-Atlantic region. Original construction ~1995, no prior major retrofits. Two stories, long axis E-W.

| Common | Lobby, corridors, mechanical rooms | 10,000 | 2 | Variable |
| **Total** | | **62,000** | | |

### Envelope (Pre-Retrofit Baseline)

| Component | Construction | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Exterior walls | Steel stud, R-11 batt, brick veneer | U-0.09 Btu/hr·ft²·°F |
| Roof | Built-up roof | R-15 assembly |
| Windows | Double-pane clear, aluminum frame | U-0.55, SHGC 0.60 |
| Window-to-wall ratio | ~25% | |
| Infiltration | ~0.5 ACH (simplified) | |

## 2. HVAC Systems

### Heating — Critical Design Decision

The building uses a **split heating strategy** that creates the required 5-parameter change-point behavior on the electric side:

| Zone | Heating System | Fuel | Why |
|------|---------------|------|-----|
| Wing A (Office) | Gas furnace in AHU-1 | Natural gas | Preserves gas vs. OAT change-point |
| Wing B (Library) | Electric heat pump / electric coil in AHU-2 | Electricity | Creates electric heating leg in 5P model |
| Wing C (Data Center) | None (constant cooling) | — | Always cooling |
| Common Areas | Gas furnace in AHU-3 | Natural gas | Preserves gas vs. OAT change-point |

### Air Handling Units — Baseline (Constant Volume)

| Unit | Serves | CFM | Fan HP | Fan ΔP | Heating | Cooling |
|------|--------|-----|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| AHU-1 | Wing A (35,000 ft²) | 15,000 | 15 | 750 Pa | Gas furnace | DX cooling |
| AHU-2 | Wing B (15,000 ft²) | 8,000 | 10 | 750 Pa | Electric coil / heat pump | DX cooling |
| AHU-3 | Common (10,000 ft²) | 5,000 | 5 | 750 Pa | Gas furnace | DX cooling |
| CRAC-1 | Wing C (2,000 ft²) | — | — | — | None | 5-ton DX, 24/7 |

### Temperature Setpoints
- Heating: 70°F occupied / 60°F unoccupied
- Cooling: 74°F occupied / 85°F unoccupied
- Data center: 68°F year-round

## 3. Internal Loads

### Lighting (Baseline)

| Zone | Fixture Type | LPD (W/ft²) | Schedule |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Wing A Offices | T8 fluorescent, magnetic ballasts | 1.3 | M-F 7am-6pm |
| Wing B Library | T8 fluorescent, high-bay | 1.4 | M-Sat 8am-9pm, Sun 12-5pm |
| Wing B Meeting | T8 fluorescent | 1.2 | ~30 hrs/wk variable |
| Wing C Data Center | T8 fluorescent | 1.5 | 24/7 |
| Common Areas | T8 fluorescent | 1.0 | M-F 6am-10pm, Sat 7am-10pm |

### Plug Loads / Equipment

| Zone | EPD (W/ft²) | Schedule | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| Wing A Offices | 1.5 | Follows occupancy, 30% standby | |
| Wing B Library | 1.0 | Follows library hours | |
| Wing C Data Center | 25.0 (baseline) | 24/7 constant | **Jumps to 35.0 W/ft² in reporting month 8 (NRA)** |
| Common Areas | 0.5 | Follows building hours | |

## 4. The Retrofit Package (ESPC Contract)

### Four ECMs — Actual Simulation Results

| ECM | Description | Combined Savings |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| ECM-1 | LED lighting + controls (Wings A & B only) | Part of 122,390 kWh |
| ECM-2 | Chiller/DX replacement (all units) | Part of 122,390 kWh |
| ECM-3 | Roof insulation upgrade (R-15 → R-30) | Part of 122,390 kWh |
| ECM-4 | VFDs on AHU supply fans (AHU-1, 2, 3) | Part of 122,390 kWh |
| **Combined** | **All ECMs** | **122,390 kWh (10.5%)** |

## 6. Key Pedagogical Features

1. **5P Electric Change-Point** — Heating leg from Wing B heat pump, cooling leg from chillers
2. **3P Gas Change-Point** — Heating-only with DHW baseload
3. **Interactive Effects** — LED retrofit removes waste heat → gas increases 6.2%
4. **NRA Detection** — Data center expansion (Aug-Dec) masks true savings
5. **Borderline Uncertainty** — 10.5% savings with monthly data → barely statistically significant
